## Introduction
Pew Pew is a 2D shooting game inspired from Steam's Aim Lab. The objective of this game is to help gamers improve their aiming and shooting speed & skills so that they can carry their team in Valorant, Overwatch, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds or basically any shooting game.

## How To Play
1. Click on the target board to score points.
2. Achieve the goal score to proceed to the next level. The speed of the target board increases after every level.
3. A little challenge is needed, miss shots will result in a deduction of points.

## Tech stack
* Visual Studio Code
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript
* Git & GitHub

## Timeline 
1 month

## Progress
1: Generate the game overall background. Create the container where the target board will appear in. Resize it so that it will fit nicely in my browser. 

2: Create all the HTML header and text for instance, the game name, levels, goals, scores and timer.

3: Create the Game Logic. Change the cursor to the snipe, and upon click, allow the bullet holes to appear.

4: Create different levels. As the level increases, the speed interval of each target board increases as well. This is the difficulty for each level.

5: Create point system. Each successful shot gives 1 point. And each missed shot deduct 1 point. 

6: Create local storage hi-scores. 

7: Add music and sound effects. 

8: Add instructions.

9. Edited the speed of the target board after each level because I have some feedbacks from players that the game is too difficult and they have difficulties getting pass level 3/4. 

## Future Developments
I got some feedbacks that the minus points for each miss shot actually made it almost impossible to get pass level 4. Because the speed of the target board was generated too fast, they end up missing every shot.

Thus in order to solve that problem and make my game more managable, one of the improvement could be for me to create 2 game modes. 

For the normal game mode, I could remove the deduction of points for the missed shots. 

While for the hard mode, the deduction of points remains. 
This way, players will be able to choose the difficulty of the game themself and practise accordingly to their respective skills.

Also another unsolved issue I have is the different browser sizes from different computer actually affects my cursor snipe and bullet hole's placing. This is something I can work on in the near future to improve my game futher.

## Summary 
All in all, I am pretty happy and satisfied with how my game turn out to be. Even though I have met a ton of obstacles since I started building on this game from stretch, I am glad that I solved them one by one with the help of my lecturers and classmates. 

I had fun building and playing the game.
